          Classification of emotions from EEG signals using Deep
          Learning</strong
        >
        <ul>
          <li>
            Deep Learning based emotion classifier using cross-wavelet spectrum.
            The emotions are classified as positive, neutral or negative. The
            cross-wavelet spectrum is produced using cross-wavelet transform on
            EEG signals. The classification of the emotions was done using the
            Deep Learning models Resnet, VGG-16, VGG-19, and DenseNet201

        <strong>Detection of Drone and its Source</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Today's drones come with sensors like GPS, LIDAR, radar, and vision
            sensors, allowing them to access features like filmmaking, farming
            and rescue operations. In addition they are also being used for
            criminal activities that endanger public safety, invasion of
            security-sensitive locations. One of the most promising approach to
            counter-attack this problem is through RF sensing. we must find any
            RF signals in an airspace setup and classify it as drone signal.
            Secondly, we have to use the Angle of Arrival approach to pinpoint
            the location of the RF signal's source. The hardware antennas are
            connected to the Matlab software in which we have set up the
            receiver model using USRP boards.

        <strong>Center based 3D Object Detection and Tracking</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            3D Object Detection and Tracking: We developed a new framework to
            detect and track 3D objects using a center-based approach. Our
            framework first detects the centers and then regresses towards other
            features such as size, shape and orientation of the object. Our
            framework was tested on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset and
            performed exceptionally.
